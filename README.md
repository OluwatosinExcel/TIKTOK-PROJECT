# TikTok Channel Data Analysis Project
# Introduction
Welcome to my TikTok Channel Data Analysis project! My name is Babalola Oluwatosin, and I'm a data analyst with a passion for uncovering insights and telling stories through data. This project is a reflection of my journey and expertise in data analysis, which I embarked on to grow my TikTok channel using data-driven strategies. Over the course of two months, I gained over 6,000 followers, and this repository contains the detailed analysis that made it possible.
# Inspiration
The inspiration for this project came from my desire to apply my data analysis skills in a real-world scenario that I am passionate about. As an aspiring content creator, I wanted to understand what makes content resonate with audiences and how I could leverage this understanding to grow my own TikTok channel. By analyzing my TikTok performance data, I aimed to uncover patterns and trends that could inform my content strategy and engagement tactics.
# Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of my TikTok channel's performance data from May 30, 2024, to July 31, 2024. The data includes information on post dates, times, likes, comments, views, favorites, songs used, voiceovers, TikTok sounds, and the presence of hashtags. The analysis follows the data analysis process stages: ASK, PREPARE, PROCESS, ANALYZE, SHARE, and ACT.
# Tools and Techniques
Throughout this project, I utilized various Microsoft Excel features and techniques, including:

•	**Data Entry:** Recording detailed metrics for each TikTok post.

•	**Functions and Formulas:** Using Excel's built-in functions and custom formulas to manipulate and analyze data.

•	**Macros and VBA:** Automating repetitive tasks to improve efficiency and accuracy.

•	**PivotTables:** Summarizing and exploring data to uncover insights.

•	**Themes:** Designing a visually appealing and professional dashboard.
# Data Analysis Process

**ASK**

The first step in my data analysis process was to define the key questions I wanted to answer:

•	What type of content resonates most with my audience?

•	What are the optimal times to post for maximum engagement?

•	How do different elements (e.g., hashtags, sounds) impact engagement metrics?

**PREPARE**

Next, I prepared my data for analysis by collecting and recording detailed information on each TikTok post. This involved:

•	Ensuring accurate data entry for all metrics.

•	Formatting the data consistently for easy analysis.

**PROCESS**

I processed the data by cleaning it and transforming it into a format suitable for analysis:

•	Removing any inconsistencies or errors in the data.

•	Categorizing date data into Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday to Sunday.

•	Creating additional columns for derived metrics.

**ANALYZE**

During the analysis phase, I used various Excel tools to uncover insights from the data:

•	**PivotTables:** To summarize data and identify patterns.

•	**Charts and Graphs:** To visualize trends and comparisons.

•	**Formulas:** To calculate engagement rates and other key metrics.

**SHARE**

I shared my findings by creating a detailed and interactive dashboard in Excel:

•	The dashboard highlights key metrics such as average views, likes, and comments by topic, hashtag usage, audio type, and time of day.

•	It provides a comprehensive overview of my TikTok channel's performance and engagement trends.

**ACT**

Based on the insights gained from my analysis, I implemented the following actions to grow my TikTok channel:
•	Focused on creating content types that performed best (e.g., informative and educational).

•	Posted at optimal times identified through the analysis.

•	Utilized hashtags and sounds strategically to boost engagement.
